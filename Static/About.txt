<<About>>

My name is Don Williamson and I'm a Brighton-based independent developer working on a concept which I'm hoping can be turned into a business. I've been a game developer for around 13 years, working in many programming roles on 14/15 or so published and un-published titles. Titles include Fable 2 & 3, Splinter Cell: Conviction, Advent Shadow, Black & White, Lucky Luke on the Daltons Trail, V-Rally, Flintstones, a couple of Army Men titles and an unanounced comic license with EA that went nowhere!

I'm going to try and keep this blog updated with what I'm currently doing and how the concept/business is progressing. My goal is to have a 6 month concept prototype ready, with a reveal coming a year from now (hit the market running as early as possible!).

I'll probably make some technical posts here and there and also plan to open-source some of the stuff I'm working on - but only if I can do so without affecting my own schedule. This is my personal blog and will not represent any company that I end up forming.
