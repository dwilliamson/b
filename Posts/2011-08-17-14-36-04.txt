<<Introducing clReflect - C++ Reflection with clang>>

Over the last few weeks I've been working, advisable or not, on what I think is a pretty reliable way of generating and using Reflection information for programs written in C++. The result is {clReflect|clReflect} - part self-indulgence, mostly incredibly useful for what I'm currently working on!

It's by no means finished but it's reached the first releasable milestone that I'm not afraid to show. There are so many uses for this, which I will cover in future blog posts.

I've been writing Reflection APIs for many years and try to shoe-horn them in on whatever project I'm working on (Splinter Cell: Conviction being by far the most successful example - more info {here|http://donw.org/rfl}). This will hopefully settle my angst at not having a decent C++ solution and stop me writing them forever more :)

Check it out, let me know what you think and if you can lend a hand, please do!
