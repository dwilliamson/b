<<A Long Overdue Status Update>>

This blog has been a bit silent of late due to some pretty amazing news we received late last year: we were expecting our first baby! Well, the little bundle of joy has arrived...

She has changed our lives in nothing but good ways and we figured early on that continuing to live in a pokey basement flat in the heart of Brighton wasn't the best way to start our family. We needed to buy a house!

Back in an earlier post I mentioned my {difficulty in getting a mortgage|2011-12-15-13-02-00}; banks won't touch you unless you're employed. And, yes, you don't even have to be employed for more than a week before they consider you worthy of being in their debt.

== The New Company ==

I decided to form a limited company and do some quick contracting work to bring some money in and get a mortgage. I ended up at {The Creative Assembly/SEGA|http://www.creative-assembly.com/} for 6 months on the {Total War: Rome II|http://www.creative-assembly.com/news/130510/total-war-rome-ii-available-pre-order} graphics team. In a short period, I wrote the landscape blending tech, optimised many parts of the engine and made a bunch more visual improvements. All of which was made to scale on a large sample of different hardware:

The main part of all that was a hybrid Procedural/Streamed Virtual Texture system that could handle 100s of thousands of active blends with massive draw distances (the Campaign Map really pushed that to its limit). Addressable textures for a landscape would total about 8 terabytes on some maps.

== The House and New Office ==

And we got the house! Unlike last time the entire process went very smoothly, taking around 5 weeks in total. We also lucked out and got a great place in Brighton for a lot less than it was worth - this view from the back is pretty cool:

The place also had a garage at the back that was converted to a workshop 20 years ago, complete with lots of electricity outlets fed from the main house. Didn't take much convincing for me to turn it into my new office :)

But damn, it's VERY cold in there! I have an electric heater but that only does so much - please think of me when working from your warm offices :)

== The Game's New Direction and Platform ==

So taking a step back from the game has made me realise that my direction was a bit muddled up. I've refined that now and will talk about it more in future posts.

More importantly, I've taken one step closer to making the game releasable from within the browser. Long gone is my native implementation hidden within a {JNI-based Java Applet|2012-11-22-13-08-40}. That hideous solution was perfect for me to get up and running and show what the browser could be capable a couple years down the line. However, Oracle is destroying the Java platform and I'd rather not release a game with the stigma of Java surrounding it. Besides, Google are {doing away with plugins|http://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html} and I want to be ready.

This was one of the happiest days of my life :)

The new solution is based heavily on some WebSockets magic, with no browser plugins required:

I can release very soon as an alpha build and still have enough time for the various web solutions out there to catch up (Empscripten, PNaCl, whatever). I have two blog posts in the works that will detail the new solution so stick around!
