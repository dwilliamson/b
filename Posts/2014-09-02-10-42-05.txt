<<Reflection in C++ Articles>>

Here's a mirror of my old reflection articles from AltDevBlogADay:

* {Reflection in C++, Part 1: Introduction|AltDevReflection1}
* {Reflection in C++, Part2: The Simple Implementation of Splinter Cell|AltDevReflectionSC}

Part 3 was close to completion but never released. However, there's a few clues here and there as to how you can view the draft on this blog :)
