<<Office Space +1>>
 
Today I managed to get some office space locked down! It's right in the middle of Brighton Laines above a book shop - I have a single room and share the building with several other small businesses (including the guy who invented and patented high-heel straps!). The great thing is that it's right in the middle of all the activity in Brighton and is only a couple minutes walk from the sea front. It's also about a 15 minute cycle from home which is absolutely perfect.

While browsing ebay I also managed to net a really cheap corner desk - I'm going to use one of the two office chairs we already have at home so won't have to spend any more money. The next most expensive investment is a development PC and test server. I'm not sure yet whether buying off the shelf or building my own will give me the best savings. My hunch is that for the lower end it'd actually be more expensive to build my own given that all the big companies (Dell, Toshiba, etc.) buy parts in bulk. I'll be investigating next week when I've managed to get our garden back into a manageable state :)
